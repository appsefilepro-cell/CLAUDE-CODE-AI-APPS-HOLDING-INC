---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### Background

**5.** Plaintiff is a victim of identity theft and fraudulent credit activity that occurred primarily in 2018-2020.

**6.** During this period, unknown third parties fraudulently opened credit accounts in Plaintiff's name and/or made unauthorized charges on existing accounts.

**7.** These fraudulent activities have caused inaccurate and incomplete information to appear on Plaintiff's credit reports maintained by Defendant.

### Inaccurate Information on Credit Report

**8.** Plaintiff's credit report maintained by Defendant contains the following inaccurate information:

| Item | Type | Claimed Balance | Status | Inaccuracy |
|------|------|----------------|--------|------------|
| [Account Name] | [Credit Card/Loan] | $[Amount] | [Status] | [Not mine/Paid/Wrong amount] |
| [Account Name] | [Credit Card/Loan] | $[Amount] | [Status] | [Not mine/Paid/Wrong amount] |
| [Add all disputed items] | | | | |

**9.** Each of these items is **inaccurate** because [explain - e.g., "account was opened fraudulently," "debt was paid," "amount is incorrect," etc.].

### Plaintiff's Dispute Process

**10.** On or about **[DATE]**, Plaintiff submitted a written dispute to Defendant pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681i, identifying the inaccurate information and requesting investigation and correction.

**11.** Plaintiff's dispute clearly identified each disputed item and the basis for the dispute.

**12.** Plaintiff provided supporting documentation including:
   - Identity theft report filed with [POLICE DEPARTMENT]
   - FTC Identity Theft Affidavit
   - Proof of payment (if applicable)
   - [Other supporting documents]

**13.** Defendant acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff's dispute on or about [DATE].

### Defendant's Inadequate Investigation

**14.** Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(1), Defendant was required to conduct a reasonable investigation of Plaintiff's dispute.

**15.** Defendant **failed** to conduct a reasonable investigation.

**16.** Specifically, Defendant's investigation was inadequate because:
   - Defendant merely forwarded Plaintiff's dispute to the furnisher of information without independent verification
   - Defendant failed to review the supporting documentation provided by Plaintiff
   - Defendant accepted the furnisher's response without question
   - Defendant failed to use all relevant information in its possession
   - The investigation was cursory and automated, not "reasonable"

**17.** On or about **[DATE]**, Defendant sent Plaintiff a response letter claiming the disputed information was "verified" and would remain on Plaintiff's credit report.

**18.** This response was inadequate and violated FCRA because:
   - Defendant failed to explain what "verification" steps were actually taken
   - Defendant did not provide copies of documents used in the investigation
   - Defendant did not explain why Plaintiff's supporting evidence was disregarded
   - The "verification" consisted merely of the furnisher confirming the information, not independent investigation

**19.** The disputed information remains on Plaintiff's credit report despite being inaccurate.

### Repeated Disputes - Same Result

**20.** Plaintiff submitted **additional disputes** on [DATE] and [DATE], again identifying the inaccuracies and providing evidence.

**21.** Each time, Defendant responded that the information was "verified" without conducting a reasonable investigation.

**22.** Defendant's pattern of inadequate investigations demonstrates willful noncompliance with FCRA.

### Harm to Plaintiff

**23.** As a direct result of Defendant's unlawful reporting of inaccurate information, Plaintiff has suffered:

   **A. Credit Score Damage:**
   - Credit score decreased from approximately [PRE-THEFT SCORE] to [CURRENT SCORE]
   - Difference of [X] points directly attributable to fraudulent/inaccurate accounts

   - Estimated lost wages: $[AMOUNT]

   **E. Security Deposits and Fees:**
   - Required to pay security deposits for utilities, housing, etc.: $[AMOUNT]
   - Application fees for repeatedly denied credit: $[AMOUNT]

   **F. Emotional Distress:**
   - Anxiety, stress, humiliation from credit denials
   - Frustration from dealing with unresponsive credit bureaus
   - Mental anguish: $[AMOUNT]

   - Time valued at reasonable rate: $[AMOUNT]

**TOTAL DAMAGES: In excess of $[AMOUNT]**
