### II. LEGAL STANDARD

**A. Fourth Amendment Protections**

The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:

> "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

This right is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).

Article I, Section 13 of the California Constitution provides parallel protections.

**B. Warrant Requirement**

"[S]earches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions." *Katz v. United States*, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967).

The prosecution bears the burden of proving that a warrantless search falls within an exception. *People v. Williams*, 20 Cal.4th 119, 126 (1999).

**C. Exclusionary Rule**

Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial. *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).

The exclusionary rule also applies to derivative evidence obtained as "fruit of the poisonous tree." *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963).

**D. Burden of Proof**

"When a defendant makes a motion to suppress evidence under section 1538.5, the trial court sits as finder of fact with the power to judge credibility, resolve conflicts, weigh evidence, and draw inferences." *People v. Celis*, 33 Cal.4th 667, 677 (2004).

---

### III. ARGUMENT

---

#### A. THE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED WITHOUT A WARRANT

[IF NO WARRANT WAS OBTAINED]

No search warrant was obtained in this case. The prosecution must therefore establish that the search falls within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. It cannot do so.

**1. No Exigent Circumstances**

The prosecution may argue that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless search. However, exigent circumstances exist only when:
- There is an immediate threat to officer or public safety;
- There is imminent destruction of evidence; or
- There is a hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect.

*People v. Ramey*, 16 Cal.3d 263 (1976).

Here, no exigent circumstances existed because [EXPLAIN - e.g., "officers had time to obtain a warrant," "no evidence was at risk of destruction," "no safety threat existed"].

**2. No Consent**

The prosecution may argue that Defendant consented to the search. However, consent must be:
- Voluntary;
- Knowing; and
- Intelligent.

*Schneckloth v. Bustamonte*, 412 U.S. 218 (1973).

Here, [CHECK APPLICABLE]:
☐ Defendant did not consent at all
☐ Defendant's "consent" was coerced by [DESCRIBE COERCION]
☐ Defendant did not have authority to consent to search of [AREA]
☐ Search exceeded scope of consent (consented to [X] but officers searched [Y])

**3. Not Incident to Lawful Arrest**

A search incident to arrest must be:
- Based on a lawful arrest; and
- Limited to the area within defendant's immediate control.

*Chimel v. California*, 395 U.S. 752 (1969).

Here, [CHECK APPLICABLE]:
☐ The arrest itself was unlawful (no probable cause)
☐ The search exceeded the permissible scope
☐ The search occurred after defendant was secured and posed no threat

**4. No Automobile Exception**

The automobile exception requires:
- Probable cause to believe the vehicle contains evidence of a crime; and
- The vehicle is readily mobile or stopped in a public place.

*California v. Carney*, 471 U.S. 386 (1985).

Here, [CHECK APPLICABLE]:
☐ Officers lacked probable cause to search the vehicle
☐ The pretext for the stop was invalid
☐ The search exceeded the scope justified by probable cause

---

#### B. THE WARRANT WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY PROBABLE CAUSE

[IF WARRANT WAS OBTAINED BUT DEFECTIVE]

Although officers obtained a search warrant, the warrant was not supported by probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment.

**1. Legal Standard for Probable Cause**

"Probable cause exists when, based on the totality of the circumstances, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place." *Illinois v. Gates*, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).

The affidavit supporting the warrant must provide sufficient facts, not mere conclusions. *People v. Kurland*, 28 Cal.3d 376, 382 (1980).

**2. Insufficient Facts in Affidavit**

The affidavit in support of the warrant [CHECK APPLICABLE]:
☐ Contains only conclusory statements without supporting facts
☐ Relies on stale information (dated [DATE], over [X] months old)
☐ Fails to establish a nexus between the evidence sought and the place to be searched
☐ Relies on unreliable informant without corroboration
☐ Contains false or misleading information (see Section C below)

**3. No Fair Probability of Finding Evidence**

Even accepting all facts in the affidavit as true, there was no "fair probability" that evidence would be found at [LOCATION] because [EXPLAIN].

---

#### C. THE WARRANT WAS BASED ON FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION

Under *Franks v. Delaware*, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), a warrant must be voided if:
1. The affidavit contains a false statement made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth; and
2. The false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.

Here, the affidavit contains the following false or misleading statements:

**False Statement #1:**
- **Affidavit states:** "[QUOTE FALSE STATEMENT]"
- **Truth:** [EXPLAIN WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE]
- **Evidence:** [HOW DEFENDANT CAN PROVE IT'S FALSE]

**False Statement #2:**
- **Affidavit states:** "[QUOTE]"
- **Truth:** [EXPLAIN]
- **Evidence:** [PROOF]

These false statements were material to the probable cause finding. Without them, no probable cause existed.

---

#### D. THE SEARCH EXCEEDED THE SCOPE OF THE WARRANT

Even if the warrant was valid, the search exceeded its scope in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

"The scope of a lawful search is 'defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.'" *Maryland v. Garrison*, 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987).

The warrant authorized a search for [DESCRIBE ITEMS IN WARRANT].

However, officers:
☐ Searched areas not described in the warrant (warrant said [X], officers searched [Y])
☐ Seized items not described in the warrant and not in plain view
☐ Conducted a more intrusive search than necessary to find the items described
☐ Other: [DESCRIBE SCOPE VIOLATION]

---

#### E. DEFENDANT'S ARREST WAS WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE

[IF CHALLENGING ARREST]

"An arrest without a warrant is per se unreasonable unless it falls within an exception to the warrant requirement." *People v. Celis*, 33 Cal.4th 667, 675 (2004).

Here, Defendant was arrested without a warrant. The arrest was not supported by probable cause because:

[EXPLAIN WHY NO PROBABLE CAUSE]:
☐ Officers had no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity
☐ Officers had no information linking Defendant to any crime
☐ The information officers relied on was from an unreliable source
☐ The alleged facts do not constitute probable cause for any crime

Because the arrest was unlawful, any evidence obtained as a result must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.

---

#### F. STATEMENTS WERE OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF MIRANDA

[IF CHALLENGING STATEMENTS/INTERROGATION]

Under *Miranda v. Arizona*, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), statements obtained during custodial interrogation are inadmissible unless the defendant was advised of and waived their Fifth Amendment rights.

**1. Defendant Was in Custody**

Defendant was in custody because [CHECK APPLICABLE]:
☐ Defendant was formally arrested
☐ Defendant was detained and a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave
☐ Officers used language or tone suggesting Defendant was not free to leave
☐ Defendant was physically restrained (handcuffs, locked room, etc.)

**2. Interrogation Occurred**

Officers interrogated Defendant by:
☐ Asking questions designed to elicit incriminating responses
☐ Making statements intended to provoke a response
☐ Creating a confrontation that was "reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response"

**3. No Adequate Miranda Warnings**

☐ No Miranda warnings were given at all
☐ Warnings were given but were incomplete or inadequate
☐ Warnings were given in English but Defendant's primary language is [LANGUAGE]
☐ Defendant invoked right to remain silent but interrogation continued
☐ Defendant invoked right to counsel but interrogation continued

**4. No Valid Waiver**

Even if warnings were given, there was no valid waiver because:
☐ Defendant did not explicitly waive rights
☐ Waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary
☐ Defendant was coerced, threatened, or promised leniency

---

### IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the search and/or seizure in this case violated the Fourth Amendment and California Constitution. All evidence obtained must be suppressed.

Without this evidence, the prosecution cannot prove its case, and the charges should be dismissed.
