   - [DATE]: Follow-up notice sent describing continued issues

**10.** Plaintiff has **failed and refused** to make repairs despite having reasonable time to do so.

**11.** Due to these uninhabitable conditions, Defendant:
   ☑ Withheld rent under Civil Code § 1942 (repair and deduct)
   ☑ Reduced rent payments proportionate to reduced habitability
   ☑ Paid for repairs and deducted cost from rent
   ☐ Placed rent in escrow pending repairs

**12.** Plaintiff's failure to maintain habitable premises is a material breach of the rental agreement and provides a complete defense to this unlawful detainer action.

**13.** Defendant is entitled to damages for:

   - Cost of temporary housing
   - Property damage caused by habitability issues
   - Personal injury (if applicable)

### SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE: RETALIATORY EVICTION

   ☐ Other protected activity: [SPECIFY]

**16.** Plaintiff's eviction action was filed on [DATE], which is within 180 days of Defendant's protected activity.

**17.** Under Civil Code § 1942.5(b), there is a rebuttable presumption that this eviction is retaliatory because it was brought within 180 days of Defendant's protected activities.

**18.** Plaintiff has not rebutted this presumption and has no legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the eviction.

**19.** Retaliatory eviction is unlawful and provides a complete defense to unlawful detainer.

**24.** Specifically, on [DATE], Plaintiff accepted $[AMOUNT] in rent for the period of [DATES].
