## FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### Background

**6.** At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff maintained checking and savings accounts with Defendant BMO Harris Bank.

**7.** Plaintiff's primary checking account (Account No. ****[LAST 4 DIGITS]) was used for personal and business transactions, including receipt of income and payment of expenses.

**8.** Plaintiff relied on these accounts for his livelihood and daily financial needs.

### The Unauthorized Zelle Transfers

**9.** In or around **[MAY-JUNE 2020]**, Plaintiff's BMO Harris account was subject to a series of unauthorized electronic fund transfers via the Zelle payment system.

**10.** Specifically, between **[START DATE]** and **[END DATE]**, unauthorized transfers totaling **$13,000.00 or more** were made from Plaintiff's account to unknown third parties.

**11.** These unauthorized transfers were made via Zelle, an electronic fund transfer service integrated with BMO Harris Bank's online banking platform.

**12.** The unauthorized transfers include, but are not limited to, the following:

| Date | Recipient | Amount |
|------|-----------|--------|
| [DATE] | [NAME/UNKNOWN] | $[AMOUNT] |
| [DATE] | [NAME/UNKNOWN] | $[AMOUNT] |
| [DATE] | [NAME/UNKNOWN] | $[AMOUNT] |
| [Additional lines as needed] | | |
| **TOTAL** | | **$13,000+** |

**13.** Plaintiff did not authorize these transfers.

**14.** Plaintiff did not know the recipients of these transfers and had never previously sent money to these individuals.

**15.** Plaintiff did not provide his banking credentials, passwords, or authorization codes to any third party.

**16.** The unauthorized transfers were the result of fraud, identity theft, or security breaches in BMO Harris Bank's systems.

### Plaintiff's Timely Notification

**17.** Upon discovering the unauthorized transfers, Plaintiff **immediately** contacted BMO Harris Bank to report the fraud.

**18.** Plaintiff specifically notified BMO Harris Bank within **two (2) business days** of discovering the unauthorized transactions, well within the time limits prescribed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E.

**19.** BMO Harris Bank acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff's fraud report and indicated it would investigate the matter.

**20.** Pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, BMO Harris Bank was required to:
   - Promptly investigate Plaintiff's claim of unauthorized transfers
   - Provisionally credit Plaintiff's account within 10 business days (or within 3 business days if the bank does not complete its investigation)
   - Complete its investigation within 45 days
   - Notify Plaintiff of the results in writing
   - Reimburse Plaintiff for unauthorized transfers if the investigation confirmed fraud

### BMO's Inadequate and Unlawful Response

**21.** Despite Plaintiff's timely and proper notification, BMO Harris Bank **failed and refused** to comply with the requirements of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E.

**22.** Specifically, BMO Harris Bank:
   - Failed to provisionally credit Plaintiff's account within the required timeframe
   - Failed to conduct a thorough and good-faith investigation
   - Failed to provide required written explanations of its findings
   - Denied Plaintiff's claim without adequate justification
   - Refused to reimburse Plaintiff for the unauthorized transfers

**23.** BMO Harris Bank's investigation was cursory, inadequate, and contrary to the requirements of federal law.

**24.** BMO Harris Bank failed to provide Plaintiff with copies of documents used in its investigation, as required by Regulation E.

**25.** BMO Harris Bank's denial of Plaintiff's claim was arbitrary, unreasonable, and in violation of federal consumer protection laws.

### Additional Harm: Account Freeze and Closure

**26.** Rather than assist Plaintiff as a victim of fraud, BMO Harris Bank took adverse actions against Plaintiff.

**27.** BMO Harris Bank **froze** Plaintiff's account, preventing him from accessing his own funds.

**28.** The account freeze occurred **during a time of extreme personal hardship** for Plaintiff, as his father was gravely ill and subsequently passed away in **[JULY 2022]**.

**29.** Plaintiff needed access to his funds to:
   - Pay for his father's medical care
   - Travel to California for his father's final days
   - Cover funeral and burial expenses
   - Maintain his own living expenses during this crisis

**30.** BMO Harris Bank's freeze of Plaintiff's account exacerbated Plaintiff's financial distress during the most difficult period of his life.

**31.** BMO Harris Bank subsequently **closed** Plaintiff's accounts without adequate notice or justification.

**32.** The account closure has damaged Plaintiff's banking history and credit profile.

**33.** Plaintiff has been unable to open accounts at other financial institutions due to negative reporting by BMO Harris Bank.

## COUNT I: VIOLATION OF ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER ACT
### (15 U.S.C. § 1693 et seq.)

**35.** Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

**36.** The Electronic Fund Transfer Act ("EFTA") establishes the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer systems.

**37.** Zelle transfers are "electronic fund transfers" as defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1693a(7).

**38.** BMO Harris Bank is a "financial institution" as defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1693a(9).

**39.** The unauthorized Zelle transfers from Plaintiff's account constitute "unauthorized electronic fund transfers" as defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1693a(12).

**40.** Under 15 U.S.C. § 1693g(a), a consumer's liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers is limited to $50 if the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft.

**41.** Plaintiff notified BMO Harris Bank within two business days of discovering the unauthorized transfers.

**42.** Therefore, Plaintiff's liability for the unauthorized transfers is limited to $50.

**43.** Under 15 U.S.C. § 1693f and Regulation E (12 CFR § 1005.11), upon receiving notification of an error or unauthorized transfer, a financial institution must:
   - Investigate promptly
   - Determine whether an error occurred
   - Report the results to the consumer within specified time limits
   - Correct the error within one business day after determining an error occurred
   - Provisionally credit the consumer's account during the investigation period in certain circumstances

**44.** BMO Harris Bank **violated** these requirements by:
   - Failing to promptly and thoroughly investigate
   - Failing to provisionally credit Plaintiff's account
   - Failing to correct the error after determining (or should have determined) that unauthorized transfers occurred
   - Failing to provide required written explanations
   - Denying Plaintiff's claim in bad faith

**45.** As a direct and proximate result of BMO Harris Bank's violations of EFTA, Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than **$[AMOUNT]**.

**46.** Under 15 U.S.C. § 1693m(a), Plaintiff is entitled to recover:
   - Actual damages
   - Statutory damages between $100 and $1,000
   - Costs of the action
   - Reasonable attorney fees

**47.** BMO Harris Bank's violations were willful, entitling Plaintiff to treble damages under applicable law.

**WHEREFORE,** Plaintiff demands judgment against Defendant BMO Harris Bank on Count I for:
- Actual damages in excess of $[AMOUNT]
- Statutory damages
- Treble damages for willful violations
- Attorney fees and costs
- Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper

### (12 CFR § 1005 et seq.)

**49.** Regulation E, promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.

**50.** 12 CFR § 1005.11 sets forth specific procedures financial institutions must follow when a consumer asserts an error, including unauthorized electronic fund transfers.

**51.** BMO Harris Bank violated 12 CFR § 1005.11 by:
   - Failing to investigate Plaintiff's error claim in accordance with regulatory requirements
   - Failing to report the results of its investigation within 10 business days (or 45 days with provisional credit)
   - Failing to provisionally credit Plaintiff's account pending investigation
   - Failing to provide required notices and documentation

**52.** 12 CFR § 1005.6(b) requires financial institutions to protect consumers from liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers.

**53.** BMO Harris Bank violated this requirement by holding Plaintiff liable for the full amount of unauthorized transfers.

**54.** As a direct and proximate result of BMO Harris Bank's violations of Regulation E, Plaintiff has been damaged as set forth above.

**WHEREFORE,** Plaintiff demands judgment against Defendant BMO Harris Bank on Count II for damages, attorney fees, costs, and other relief.
