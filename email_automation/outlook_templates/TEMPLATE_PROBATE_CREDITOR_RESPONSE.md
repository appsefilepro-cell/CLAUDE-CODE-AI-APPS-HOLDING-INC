## TEMPLATE 5: NO ESTATE ASSETS - CLAIMS CANNOT BE PAID

**Subject:** Estate of Thurman Robinson Sr. - Insufficient Assets

Dear [Creditor Name]:

Thank you for filing your creditor's claim in the Estate of Thurman Robinson Sr.

After conducting a thorough inventory and appraisal of the estate's assets, I must inform you that the estate has **insufficient assets** to pay all creditor claims.

**Estate Financial Summary:**
- Total Estate Assets: $[AMOUNT]
- Administration Costs: $[AMOUNT]
- Higher Priority Claims: $[AMOUNT]
- **Remaining Available for Other Claims: $[AMOUNT or $0]**

**Your Claim:**
- Amount: $[AMOUNT]
- Priority Class: [Class number/description]

Unfortunately, after paying administration costs and higher-priority claims, there are insufficient funds remaining to pay your claim [in full / at all].

**Your Options:**
1. **Accept partial payment** (if any funds available): $[AMOUNT or $0]
2. **Pursue the debt against any party who may be personally liable** (not the estate)

**Important:** The administrator (myself) is not personally liable for estate debts. The estate's assets are the sole source of payment.

If you wish to accept partial payment (if available), please confirm in writing. Otherwise, this notice serves as notification that your claim cannot be satisfied from estate assets.

I apologize for this unfortunate situation. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
